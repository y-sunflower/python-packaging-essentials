# Python Packaging Essentials

The aim of this site it to provide all the must known practices when it comes to create a Python package. It offers 10 blog posts, where each of them covers one topic with a few key points. The goal here is to empower anyone with just basic Python knowledge.

We’ll over concrete examples, use clear explanations, and try as much as possible to go straight to the point.

### Good to know

- All blog posts are independant. Even if they follow some sort of order, it’s perfectly fine to just look at what interests you.
