# Python Packaging Essentials

The aim of this site it to provide all the must known practices when it comes to create a Python package. It offers **10 blog posts**, where each of them covers one topic with a few key points. The goal here is to empower anyone with just basic Python knowledge.

We'll over concrete examples, use clear explanations, and try as much as possible to go straight to the point so that anyone with some Python knowledge can create their own Python packages.

### Good to know

- All blog posts are **independant**. Even if they follow some sort of order, it's perfectly fine to just look at what interests you.
- This site is [open source](https://github.com/yellow-sunflower/python-packaging-essentials/) and in **continuous improvement**.  If you want to suggest an improvement (correct an error, improve an explanation, add an example or anything else), it's more than welcomed. It starts [here](https://github.com/yellow-sunflower/python-packaging-essentials/).
- You can download the **PDF** version of this site in the top left of the site / navigation bar.
