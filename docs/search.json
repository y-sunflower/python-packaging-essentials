It offers 10 blog posts, where each of them covers one topic with a few key points. The goal here is to empower anyone with just basic Python knowledge.\nWe’ll over concrete examples, use clear explanations, and try as much as possible to go straight to the point so that anyone with some Python knowledge can create their own Python packages.\n\nGood to know\n\nAll blog posts are independant. Even if they follow some sort of order, it’s perfectly fine to just look at what interests you.\nThis site is open source and in continuous improvement. If you want to suggest an improvement (correct an error, improve an explanation, add an example or anything else), it’s more than welcomed. It starts here.\nYou can download the PDF version of this site in the top left of the site / navigation bar.",

Whether you want to publish a library for the world or just organize your own projects better, understanding how packaging works is the first step.\nAt its simplest, a package is just a folder that contains an __init__.py file.\nThe presence of __init__.py tells Python: “this is a package.”\nEven if it’s an empty file, it’s important—it allows you to import parts of your code like this:\nWithout it, Python treats the folder as a regular directory, not something it can import from.",

This licence is important because it tells other people what they are allowed to do with your package.\nIt is specific to each project, but you can find out more at choosealicence.com.\nHere is an example of the most common licence: the MIT licence.\nCopyright (c) 2025 Your Name\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

There are no rules about what to do with this file, it’s just used to tell people what is the first thing they should read before using your package.\nFor example, it could be something like this:\n# sunflower: my cool Python package\n\nWelcome to the homepage of the `sunflower` project.\n\nIt's a new project, but it will be available soon!\n\n\nA file that we will use to test and use our package. It’s optional but very practical.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, we haven’t written a single line of Python code, yet we already have a lot of files and directories.

    "text": "2.3 Add Python code\nWhen creating a Python package, we want to write a reusable piece of code, not just put in a few scripts that do things. To illustrate:\n\nNot reusable codeReusable code\n\n\n\nname = \"Joseph\"\nmessage = f\"Hello {name}\"\nprint(message)\n\nHello Joseph\n\n\nThis code does something: it prints a message.\n\n\n\ndef say_hello(name):\n   message = f\"Hello {name}\"\n   print(message)\n\nThe code above does ‘nothing’. The only thing it does is create a function object that will be stored in memory. I can now call it and it will execute some code. For example:\n\nsay_hello(\"Joseph\")\n\nHello Joseph\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we’ll keep things simple and assume that we only want to provide functions and classes in our package.\nNow, let’s create our first Python module (which is just a file ending in .py). We’ll call it module1.py, but it can be anything. The only thing we want to stick to when naming files is:\n\nuse lowercase only\navoid spaces and odd characters\nkeep it short\nuse underscores “_”\n\n\nBad file namesGood file names\n\n\nmy file.py\nMyfile.py\nmyFile.py\nmy@file.py\nmy-file.py\nthis-file-does-this-and-that.py\n\n\nmy_file.py\nmyfile.py\n\n\n\nSo let’s put our module1.py in sunflower/sunflower/, which will give us:\nsunflower/\n├── sunflower/\n│   └── module1.py\n├── .git/\n├── .venv/\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── LICENSE\n├── sandbox.py\n└── pyproject.toml\nIn module1.py, we’re going to add our very first function to our package. For example, we’ll create a count_sunflower() function. This function will count how many times the word ‘sunflower’ occurs in a given string.\nimport re\n\ndef count_sunflowers(s):\n   s = re.sub(r\"[^a-zA-Z\\s]\", \"\", s)  # Remove non-text characters\n   s = s.lower()                      # Convert to lowercase\n   n_sunflower = s.split().count(\"sunflower\")\n   n_sunflowers = s.split().count(\"sunflowers\")\n   return n_sunflower + n_sunflowers\nWe’re now going to add a __init__.py file in the same place as the module1.py file that contains our previous function. This is a special Python file. It tells Python that the sunflower/sunflower/ directory is a package, which will allow us to import functions from that package into the outside world.\nWe now have this:\nsunflower/\n├── sunflower/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   └── module1.py\n├── .git/\n├── .venv/\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── LICENSE\n├── sandbox.py\n└── pyproject.toml\nThe __init__.py file should look like this:\nfrom .module1 import count_sunflowers\n\n__all__ = [\"count_sunflowers\"]\nAnd well done! You may not have realised it, but we already have a Python package that can be used with a function.",

Let’s name this function _clean_string() and place it in a new file: module2.py.\nimport re\n\ndef _clean_string(s):\n   s = re.sub(r\"[^a-zA-Z\\s]\", \"\", s)  # Remove non-text characters\n   s = s.lower()  # Convert to lowercase\n   return s\nOur code in module1.py should now become:\nfrom .module2 import _clean_string\n\ndef count_sunflowers(s):\n   s = _clean_string(s)\n   n_sunflower = s.split().count(\"sunflower\")\n   n_sunflowers = s.split().count(\"sunflowers\")\n   return n_sunflower + n_sunflowers\nWe now have 2 functions:\n\ncount_sunflowers() a public function that users of the package will use.\n_clean_string() a private function used internally. The underscore (‘_’) at the beginning of the function name tells other people that it should not be used outside the package from which it came.\n\nNote that _clean_string() is still usable by users if they run it:\nfrom sunflower.module2 import _clean_string\nBut as you can see from the documentation blog post, we won’t have or create documentation on these functions, so they’re unlikely to find it anyway.",
