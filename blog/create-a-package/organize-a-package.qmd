title: "Organize a package"
---

In order to follow the steps below, you'll need to have both [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed on your machine. Both are command-line tools, meaning you'll use your terminal to run commands that perform various actions.

Let's assume we're naming our Python package *"sunflower"*, with a single function:

```markdown
sunflower/
└── sunflower/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── my_module.py
```

To learn about this structure and why we need a `__init__.py` file, check out the [previous blog post](./introduction-to-packaging.html).

We'll also assume that `my_module.py` looks like this:

```{.python filename="sunflower/my_module.py"}
import re

def count_sunflowers(s):
   s = re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z\s]", "", s)  # Remove non-text characters
   s = s.lower()                      # Convert to lowercase
   n_sunflower = s.split().count("sunflower")
   n_sunflowers = s.split().count("sunflowers")
   return n_sunflower + n_sunflowers
```

The `__init__.py` file look like this:

```{.python filename="sunflower/__init__.py"}
from .my_module import count_sunflowers

__all__ = ["count_sunflowers"]
```

## Add main Python project files

Next, we need to create a few essential files at the root of the project.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### `pyproject.toml`

All the package metadata. It will contain a lot of useful information when we want to distribute this PyPI package so that everyone can install it easily. Don't worry too much about all of its content.

Here is a simple version of this file:

```{.toml filename="pyproject.toml"}
[project]
name = "sunflower"
description = "Create pretty sunflowers"
version = "0.1.0"
license = "MIT"
license-files = ["LICENSE"]
keywords = ["sunflower", "flower"]
authors = [
  { name="your_name", email="your_name@mail.com" },
]
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.9"
classifiers = [
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha"
]
dependencies = []

[build-system]
requires = [
    "setuptools",
    "setuptools-scm",
]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[tool.setuptools]
packages = ["sunflower"]

[tool.uv.sources]
sunflower = { workspace = true }

[project.urls]
Homepage = "https://your_name.github.io/sunflower/"
Issues = "https://github.com/your_name/sunflower/issues"
Documentation = "https://your_name.github.io/sunflower/"
Repository = "https://github.com/your_name/sunflower"
```

### `LICENSE`

A basic text file containing the licence for your package. This licence is important because it tells other people what they are allowed to do with your package.

It is specific to each project, but you can find out more at [choosealicence.com](https://choosealicense.com/).

Here is an example of the most common licence: the MIT licence.

```{.txt filename="LICENSE"}
Copyright (c) 2025 Your Name

SOFTWARE.
```

### `.git/`

This is a directory used internally by the Git software to track all changes in the project. Assuming that the first *"sunflower"* directory is in your `Desktop/` directory, you should create this directory by running the `git init` command when you are in the `Desktop/sunflower/` directory.

It's very likely that __you won't see it__, as most operating systems (Windows, MacOS, etc.) hide files/directories that start with `.`, but it doesn't matter. This directory will be managed entirely by Git itself, so we recommend that you __never make any manual changes to it__.

### `.gitignore`

A file in which each line describes one or more files/directories that are not explicitly part of the project or are not relevant in general. Don't worry too much about this, you can just start with the example content below.

It is very likely that __you will not see it__ outside your code editor, as most operating systems (Windows, MacOS, etc.) hide files/directories that start with `.`, but that doesn't matter.

```{.txt filename=".gitignore"}
# Python-generated files
__pycache__/
*.py[oc]
build/
dist/
wheels/
*.egg-info

# Virtual environments
.venv/
venv/
.env/
env/

# VS code config
.vscode/

# files on mac
.DS_Store

# all cache files
*cache*

# Sandbox files
sandbox.py
sandbox.ipynb
```

### `.venv/`

A directory containing all the things we need to work properly in our Python environment. It contains a Python interpreter, all the packages used in the project (e.g. `numpy`, `requests`, etc), and a few other things.

The best way to create one is to run `uv venv`.

It is very likely that you will **not** see it outside your code editor, as most operating systems (Windows, MacOS, etc.) hide files/directories that start with `.`, but that doesn't matter.

### `README.md`

A markdown file that describes the project, gives advice on how to use it, install it and so on. There are no rules about what to do with this file, it's just used to tell people what is the first thing they should read before using your package.

For example, it could be something like this:

```{.md filename="README.md"}
# sunflower: my cool Python package

Welcome to the homepage of the `sunflower` project.

It's a new project, but it will be available soon!
```

### `sandbox.py`

A file that we will use to test and use our package. It's optional but practical.

:::

<br>

The organisation of our project now looks like this:

```markdown
sunflower/
├── sunflower/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── my_module.py
├── .git/
├── .venv/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── sandbox.py
└── pyproject.toml
```

## Add an internal function

When creating a package, it is very practical to create functions that we will use internally: inside the package itself.

If we go back to our previous example, we might want to have a separate function that takes a string and cleans it up by removing non-text characters and putting it in lower case. Let's name this function `_clean_string()` and place it in a new file: `other_module.py`.

```{.python filename="sunflower/other_module.py"}
import re

def _clean_string(s):
   s = re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z\s]", "", s)  # Remove non-text characters
   s = s.lower()                      # Convert to lowercase
   return s
```

Our code in `my_module.py` should now become:

```{.python filename="sunflower/my_module.py"}
from .other_module import _clean_string

def count_sunflowers(s):
   s = _clean_string(s)
   n_sunflower = s.split().count("sunflower")
   n_sunflowers = s.split().count("sunflowers")
   return n_sunflower + n_sunflowers
```

We now have 2 functions:

- `count_sunflowers()` a **public** function that users of the package will use.
- `_clean_string()` a **private** function used internally. The underscore ('`_`') at the beginning of the function name tells other people that it should not be used outside the package from which it came.

Note that `_clean_string()` is still usable by users if they run it:

```py
from sunflower.other_module import _clean_string
```

But as you can see from the [documentation blog post](./writing-documentation.html), we won't have or create documentation on these functions, so they're unlikely to find it anyway.

## Final organization

After all these steps, our package now looks like this:

```markdown
sunflower/
├── sunflower/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── my_module.py
│   └── other_module.py
├── .git/
├── .venv/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── sandbox.py
└── pyproject.toml
```
